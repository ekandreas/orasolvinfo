=== WORK IN PROGRESS ===

Simple Social Intranet based on the following components:

* Bedrock for stable WordPress config foundation
* Papi for page type models (plugin)
* ElasticPress with Elasticsearch for excellent search functionality (plugin+service)
* Sage for WordPress theme foundation
* Bootstrap-sass and Bootflat for theme design development
* Blade for theme templating
* Groups for access requirements (plugin)
* Mandrill for mail delivery engine (composer component)
* Redirection for redirects and short urls
* PHP Deployer for deployment and Continuous Integration

Every component must be open source in the project.
As for company specific integrations and functions, plugin develpment should be used.
